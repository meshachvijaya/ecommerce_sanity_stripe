An ecommerce website build with Next.js, Sanity as CMS for Product, and Stripe for Payment

Link to Live WebApp https://ecommerce-sanity-stripe-ebon.vercel.app/

Note: This WebApp still have a bug on Cart, when I want to increase quantity on cart, the item order will change. So I don't get it how to fix it right now, if anybody can fix the code, I think on the UseStateContext.js, you can freely to modify the code.
